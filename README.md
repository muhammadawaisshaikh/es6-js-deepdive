# Observables
Observables provide support for passing messages between publishers and subscribers in your application, As a publisher, you create an Observable instance that defines a subscriber function. This is the function that is executed when a consumer calls the subscribe() method. The subscriber function defines how to obtain or generate values or messages to be published.
